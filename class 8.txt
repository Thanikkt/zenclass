Scripting - 

What is scripting?
to automate any manual task using a scripting language. Eg - shell, python, go, powershell, ruby, javascript 

every morning, i need to run apt update
apt autoclean
rm -rf /var/log/custom.log
simply create a script --> script.sh --> add it to a cron job

shell -->
it uses linux commands inside the script, no additional requirements needed

shell script should start with -->
#!/bin/bash --> this is the interpretor to run the script
is it necessary ? No (if it is not specified , the existing shell on which the user is logged into will be taken as the interpretor)

how to execute the script ?
you need to set execute permissions - chmod +x file.sh
either use - ./file.sh
or
bash file.sh 

what are variables ??
variables are small storage items which can store values which can be modified

Environment Variables - 
In linux , there are environment variables that can be defined for each user and for complete OS
command - printenv

to display specific variable from the env - echo $envname , eg - echo $USER
to set an env var - export var="myenv"

inside the script - 

var1="somthing" --> string 
type of values  --> string, int, float, binary
eg for int` - 
var1=3
eg for float 
var1=3.10
eg for binary 
var1=true --> it can be true or false (0 or 1)


to echo the output of a command 

echo $(date)


configuration for your shell (for ubuntu)
 - ~/.bashrc
add alias or set env variables and save the file
source ~/.bashrc  --> to reload shell configs
alternative option to reload - relogin to same user or restart your system

other important types of variables - 

1. list
2. array

cronjobs - (crontab) 
to schedule and run a command or a script 



scp - to cp between 2 servers securely 
eg - 
scp -i "C:\Users\alfat\Downloads\firstkey.pem" "C:\Users\alfat\OneDrive\Documents\DevOPs\sample3.sh" ubuntu@18.204.1.210:/tmp
scp -i pem srcfile desaddress:/place


sample script -->

#!/bin/bash

x=3
y=4
echo "$x is the value of x"
echo "$y is the value of y"
echo "$(( $x + $y )) is the output"
echo "$(date) -  $0 is the script name"
