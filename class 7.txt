eg - ping google.com 
ping 127.0.0.1

2. telnet command --> to check network connectivity on specific port on a specific server
eg - telnet 44.201.91.246 22
alternative -  nc -zv ec2-44-201-91-246.compute-1.amazonaws.com 80


3. netstat (old) / ss -->how to check which ports are open in linux machine

6. nslookup - a simple command to check the ip address destination 
eg - 
nslookup ec2-44-201-91-246.compute-1.amazonaws.com
Server:         127.0.0.53
Address:        127.0.0.53#53

Firewall -->
eg - Security groups (outside the machine )
This is to allow / disallow network traffic to / from another network CIDR 
Ingress --> inbound traffic
Egress --> outbound traffic

inside the machine - 
eg - ufw, firewalld

Advanced level of firewall - iptable

ssh - 

the communication between client and server using port 22 is secured by encryption

config file - /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Full Setup for a New Linux User
1. Create the user on the server:
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash demouser
sudo passwd demouser  # optional: set a password
2. Generate the key pair (on your local machine or the server):
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "demouser" -f /tmp/demouser_key -N ""
3. Set up the public key for the user:
# Create .ssh directory for demouser
sudo mkdir -p /home/demouser/.ssh
sudo cp /tmp/demouser_key.pub /home/demouser/.ssh/authorized_keys
# Set correct ownership and permissions
sudo chown -R demouser:demouser /home/demouser/.ssh
sudo chmod 700 /home/demouser/.ssh
sudo chmod 600 /home/demouser/.ssh/authorized_keys
